all Exercises includes basic implementation to exercise test automation with test framework JUnit. **The order of exercises represents the complexity** of each exercise. First Exercises includes more information and step-by-step guidelines. 

Graphics are visual impressions for easier understanding for this exercises and will not be part of the exercises.

### Calculator Exercise ###

Easy Starting Exercise with first running Test and pre-defined Test-Cases. Try to test basic math operations.

### Loan Calculator Exercise ###

Calculates monthly repayment, total cost and interest cost for a multi-year credit with a fixed yearly interest rate. Test methods are already predefined (but without step-by-step instructions)

### Distance Exercise ###

![Coordinate System with two Points](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Kartesisches_system.svg/600px-Kartesisches_system.svg.png)

Popular High-School example with coordinate system to determine distance between two Points. Pre-Defined Test-Cases with Test-Instruction supports for creating next Test Code.

### Tick Vaccination Adviser Exercise ###

Advises when to get the next vaccination against ticks. This example uses date classes from the JAVA SDK. Test methods are already predefined (but without step-by-step instructions)

### Stack Exercise ###

![Stack with LIFO - Last In First Out](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/Lifo_stack.png/700px-Lifo_stack.png)

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

- **push**, which adds an element to the collection
- **pop**, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

Some Test-Cases are pre-defined, but others has to be designed by yourself.

### Queue Exercise ###

![Queue FIFO - First In First Out](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Data_Queue.svg/600px-Data_Queue.svg.png)

A queue is another abstract data type that also serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

- **enqueue** (offer), which adds an element to the collection
- **dequeue** (poll), which removes the first added element

There are **no** Test-Cases defined, so you have to design your own Test-Cases the first time. This Example also **includes some Bugs**, which has to be founded by **Debugging** in your IDE
