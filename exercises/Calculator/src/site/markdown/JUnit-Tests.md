# JUnit Test #

TODO try to add content by yourself

**TODO Try to answer following questions**

1. Why do we need JUnit Tests?
2. Why do we need to test all Basic Java Classes? Which kind of implementation we are not able to test?
3. Why do we need Naming Conventions at all? e.g. JUnit Tests [Naming Conventions for Maven Surefire Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/inclusion-exclusion.html)
4. Why we are separate source code and test code?
